# Spaceballs! Memory Game

## Overview

This is a simple game application built in React that demonstrates basic concepts such as components, managing component state, and responding to user events.

### Game Parameters

1. The application renders an array of Spaceballs characters to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

2. The application keeps track of the user's score through state changes and increments the score with each correct image click. The user's score will reset to 0 if the same image is clicked more than once.

3. Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

4. Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will reset by taking the user's score back to 0.
